# Constrained Zig

Check out the code [here](https://github.com/LukasPietzschmann/zigchr).

## Build it
1. You need to clone using the `--recursive` switch
2. Just call `latexmk` on the `talk.tex` file

If you don't want to build the slides yourself, you can also download them [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LukasPietzschmann/zigtoberfest-talk/build/talk.pdf) or [here](https://github.com/LukasPietzschmann/zigtoberfest-talk/blob/build/talk.pdf).
